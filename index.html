            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                OlÃ¡! My name is Pedro Moura, I was born and raised in Brassssssil ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·. 
                I'm currently a Computer Science undergrad student at Florida Institute of 
                Technology, based in Melbourne FL.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lately, my interests are leading more towards AI and Machine Learning, 
                specially Deep Learning. However, I've had the opportunity to work on
                various projects in different areas from developing a supply-chain automation
                system for data centers, to building this mind-blowing webpage - sarcasm.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, I still find myself exploring new areas because I have not 
                found something I really enjoy doing or see myself doing on the
                long run.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some "fun" facts about me: I can do a wheelie on a wheelchair, V7 rock 
                climber (V3 in my home gym), best surfer in my house, and I like eating cheese.
            </p>

                <img src="images/climb.gif" alt="me falling" width="200" height="200" />

                <p>
                    Try to redict using a regression model the hardest V grade a climber 
                    can climb based on personal features - height, weight, sex, wingspam, etc.
                    The goal was to use this as a "safety threshold", where climbers could follow
                    the grade suggested, and consequently avoid getting injured (like me in the gif).

                    After my last two experieces, I decided that I wanted to do something more impactful
                    than just keep looking a screen 40hr/week. So, I declined my return offer and took a
                    flight to the country side of South China - where there are not many foreigners. 
                    1-2 hours/day of conversation practice is a rare treat that helps a lot with 
                    their education. Giving them an opportunity to practice what they can only learn 
                    from a classroom and through media.

                    There I was part of AWS Infra Suppy Chain Automation team, where I 
                    optimized brick and patch rack optics planning in AWS Data Centres based on 
                    networking logistics. Also, developed Batch jobs to collect rack data from inventory 
                    projections, process it to generate optics demand forecasts, and send it downstream 
                    for optics ordering.

                <p>
                    My team was under FinTech Organization, so we had to preprocess a lot of invoices
                    data. For my project, I built a landing page using React where other teams could 
                    search and apply filters to find specific invoices easier. Also, developed a "User Preferences"
                    page to help usability. Ended up finishing my project before deadline, so I started adding
                    some features requested by users (both my team and other teams).
